/** Implicit solver with Newton iterations to solve the non-linear implicit equation at arbitrary precision.

    The method computes the next velocity \f$ v(t+h) \f$, such that equation \f$ M (v(t+h)-v(t)) - hf \f$ is satisfied, where the usual conventions of this integrator are (see parent class):
    - \f$ f = \alpha f(t+h) + (1-\alpha) f(t) \f$ is a weighted sum of the current and next force,
    - \f$ x(t+h) = x(t) + h (\beta v(t+h) + (1-\beta) v(t)\f$ is the next position, where the next force is computed, using the next velocity.

    The method iteratively improves an approximate solution by solving a linear equation system based on the Jacobian of the residual of the equation to satisfy.
