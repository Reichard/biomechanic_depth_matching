A simple qt application featuring the registration of a scene to a volumetric image, using the SofaSimpleGUI API.
The registration is represented by a Sofa scene loaded at initialization time.
The scene describes both the data and the algorithms to process it.
Therefore, this application is essentially a viewer.

The path to the scene must be given in the command line, e.g.:
bin/Registration_run  -f /home/evasion/ffaure/vcs/imr/example/knee/precompute_model.py
