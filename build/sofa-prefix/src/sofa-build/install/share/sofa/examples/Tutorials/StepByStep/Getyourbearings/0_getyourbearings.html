		This small tutorial presents a description of three components that would help you to design simulation scenes.
		All of them give visual information about the location and orientation of the camera and visual models in respect to the scene.

		This first step of the tutorial display a visual model of the liver with the component OglModel.
		As you can notice, by default in SOFA, it is impossible to get hints about the orientation, size and location of the model in the scene.
